1 + 2 * 3 + 4
PosFix String: 1 2 3 * + 4 +
OP Stack: 
Op S Pop: * + +

As we see a number:
	Append it to string
	If we see an operator:
		Check precedence of new operator compared to the latest one in stack
			If higher push
			If lower, pop stack (add it to the string), and precedence check the new operator
	at end of notation: pop everything and push it into the stack
